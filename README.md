# very-old-demos

Some old demos coded by me that were on my server and I didn't want to lose
track of.

I make no promises about the quality of this code, most of it probably dates to
2013 approx. :)

But it shouldn't be hard to make it run with a basic-ish PHP server.

All the code here is public domain, unless stated otherwise.
